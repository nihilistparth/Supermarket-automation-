### Problem

### Description

- The supermarket stocks a set of items.
- Customers pick up their desired items from the in
    required quantities. The customers present these
    items to the sales-clerk.
- The sales-clerk registers the items in the
    softwareand then after adding all the quantities
    to the cart generates the Bill, and the transaction
    gets recorded.
- The manager can view the various transaction
    and can manage the clerks and the inventory.


##### Problem

##### Specification

##### and Users

##### Involved

#### Manager:

- Edit Users
- Edit Inventory
- Add Product
- Create Report

#### Clerk:

- Transaction
- View Inventory


## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python, Django
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript
    (chart.js)
- Database: SQLite


### Why Python

### and Django?

```
Python is a high-level programming language,
which has the support for full stack
development, via powerful frameworks such
as Django.
```
```
Also, Python is an Object-Oriented Language,
which makes theAbstraction of the Problem
simpler, as we are able to relate it with real life
entities.
```
```
Also,Django provides us with many built in
functionalities like Login, Register User (which
are already heavily tested beforehand, and
thus make the software themore Robust).
```
```
Django also provideseasy and robust
databasemanagement, viamodels (whichis
classbased and uses SQLite).
```

# Challenging

# Use Cases

- Need to manually install a .DLL file
    for using JSONField(only
    forWindows).
- chart.js: The first choice to plot
    graphs was obviously the Matplotlib
    library. But after a bit of thinking,
    we chanced upon chart.js, which is
    more interactive and robust.


### Future

### Improvements

- Implementation of a Payment
    Gateway
- Security:
    1. HTTPS instead of HTTP should be used
    2. DDOS Prevention
- Distribution through Docker
- Hosting the Database Through
    AWS / Azure for faster use
